# Creating content with Devise

{% hint style="info" %}
The following documentation assumes that you have already have Devise installed and running in a development environment. If you haven't, no big deal. Jump over the the Getting Started section of this documentation and get a project up and running real quick-like and then come back here.

## Content in Devise: An Overview

Devise, like many content management systems, is made of pages with content on them. However, it's important to understand the overall hierarchy of content so designers, developers, and content managers can wrap their heads around what is possible. 

#### Sites: Multi-tenancy

Devise can contain many "websites" in a single installation. What this means is content managers can reuse media and page layouts throughout many sites. This helps maintain branding and style guides and provides a central location for the team to update content.

#### Pages

A page that appears on a site has a unique URL and serves as the container for all the content your team wishes to publish. Pages in Devise also contain versions that can serve as a location to stage content before publishing and A\|B test.

#### Slices

Slices are small parts of pages that a content manager can add to a page to add content. Slices can appear in any order and can also be nested within each other to build complex structures.
