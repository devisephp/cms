# Fields

## About Fields and Use Case

Ok, what exactly are fields and when should they be used. Devise fields are anywhere you want to use non-model-driven dynamic data. A few examples that everyone has run into now and again:

* The "About Us" paragraph on the About page.
* The array of slides that appear in the slideshow hero on the homepage.
* The accent color of a page.
* The legal copy of the site's Terms and Conditions in English, Spanish and Pashtun.

Creating administration sections in your application that is already doing a bunch of other "real" tasks can be a pain, time consuming, and expensive. By implementing Devise fields in your slices you can do two very awesome things:

1. You provide a very easy way for the content manager to make in-context edits to the site.
2. You provide a way for your team to recycle design patterns again and again and again throughout your site.

This provides your team to be creative when making new templates, easier code to maintain, and quickly and cheaply test different scenarios with end users to find what works best.
