# Creating our first page

## Creating your first page.

Since there is no "backend" administration on Devise you must go to a page that will render. You created a page \(most likely the homepage\) during the installer so head to whatever page that is and you should see something like the following:

**TODO: IMAGE**

Click on the gear on the left hand menu and then click "Pages". Click "create new page" and fill out the form like the example below:

**TODO: IMAGE**

Once your page has been saved go to the url you provided in the _slug_ field and you should see something like below. Congratulations! Now we can begin populating this new page with slices and content.
