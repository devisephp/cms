# Installation

While you can develop in any PHP 7.1 environment this assumes you are using [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/valet) and have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos) composer setup correctly.

## Create a new Laravel Project

```text
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel my-devise-project
```

## Install Devise

```text
cd my-devise-project
composer require devisephp/cms
```

## Publish Assets

```text
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=dvs-assets
```

## Finish Install Wizard

Now you can visit your site at `http://my-devise-project.test` and finish the install wizard. The wizard will update automatically as you complete various tasks. When creating your first user you will be logged in as that user and once complete will see the editor on the left side of the screen.

## What Now?

If you followed the wizard exactly you will be presented with that first test slice that you created. It's pretty boring but serves as a good boilerplate for other slices. Take a look at your design. See what repeats, what can be used in multiple places. Those natural lines help define which slices you should probably create.

For guidance on slice creation take a look at how we build the [Devise Marketing](https://github.com/devisephp/marketing) site and, of course, the [documentation](https://devise.gitbook.io/cms/).
