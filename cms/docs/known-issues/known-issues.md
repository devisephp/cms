## Resorting Slices over Iframes

There is a [known issue](https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable/issues/1388) where you pick up, but not drop when the page editor is over an iframe. This is not an issue with z-index but, rather, a limitation of Chrome and / or the Sortable library we are using. Any help on this issue is greatly appreaciated.
