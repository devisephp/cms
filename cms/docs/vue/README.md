# Vue Integration / Customizing Devise

> Note: This documentation is written with the assumption that you have some experience with VueJS. If you've never worked with Vue before you'll be fine. We suggest you take a look at the following documents to get your feet wet and then come back. We've chosen these pages in the documentation because they are the most applicable when talking about Vue and Devise.
>
> [VueJS Introduction](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) If you're going to read one whole page of documentation read this one. Really, read it. I bet it'll really clear some things up.
>
> [Lifecycle Diagram](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Lifecycle-Diagram) This diagram is a really good reference to keep coming back to as you learn when things happen in the Vue component experience.
>
> [Component Basics](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html) This is a great primer on what a compoenent is and understanding it's parts.
>
> [Props](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html) Props are a big part of Vue and Devise. It's how we get information from the editor into a custom component 99% of the time.
